message = Hey, I've just been added to {server}! In order for my features to work, you need to go to a channel for confessions and type `{p:global}set`.

[help]
introduction = - **DM me your anonymous messages to have them appear on the server!** *You might be asked to choose a channel if you have access to more than 1 confession channel.*
	- Admins can use the following commands as long as they start the command with the prefix `{p:local}`{longprefix? *you can also use `{longprefix}`*|}.
	- Mods can use shuffle and ban.
	- Everyone can use `{p:local}list` to get a list of all the channels avaiable to them.
	
	**Still have questions?**
	Get dedicated support from the developer and other users on the [support server]({serverinv}).
bot_description = {c:main/botname} is the most advanced confessions bot on Discord, with mod tools, multiple confessions channels types, image support, and much more!
	To start, `{p:local}set` a confessions channel.
about_field1_title = üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Moderation tools
about_field1_value = With the power of anonymous IDs generated for each user (when using a traceable confessions channel), moderators can ban anon-IDs when nessecary, or shuffle anon-IDs if someone is at risk of being found out.
about_field2_title = üí¨ Confessions channel types
about_field2_value = Admins can create confessions channels that are completely untraceable, traceable (for mod tools), vetted (require vetting before being posted publicly), or feedback (can be anonymously sent to without needing to see the resulting confessions).
about_field3_title = üñº Image support
about_field3_value = Images are automatically sent through with confessions by default, which is surprisingly uncommon of a feature in confession bots. *Note, though that there is an NSFW filter forced on by Discord and it can't be disabled*
about_field4_title = üåç Translation support
about_field4_value = {c:main/botname} can be easily translated with the help of the community to other languages, check `{p:local}language` to see existing translations.
about_field5_title = üíµ Even more features with premium
about_field5_value = Support development and hosting costs while also getting some nice perks by going premium. Learn more about premium perks by using `{p:local}premium`.

[confessions]
command_set_help = {p:local}set (none|traceable|untraceable|vetting|feedback)
	Sets a channel for confessions. You need to specify the channel type (eg `{p:local}set traceable`) like one of the below;
	- `none`, unsets a channel that was previously set to one of the rest.
	- `traceable`, includes anon-ids, makes banning possible and allows other users to tell each other apart.
	- `untraceable`, no anon-ids, makes telling users apart more difficult, and exposing a message history impossible.
	- `vetting`, (intended for mod only channels) confessions need approval here before being posted elsewhere.
	- `feedback`, users can anonymously post here without seeing the channel. good for server feedback or suggestion boxes.
command_list_help = {p:local}list
	Lists all currently available confessions channels on this server.
command_ban_help = {p:local}ban (anon-id)
	Ban any anon-id. Bans persist between shuffles, so keep note of their anon-id.
	Unban by putting a minus before their id.
command_shuffle_help = {p:local}shuffle
	Resets all anon-ids to make it anonymous whenever someone is found out.
command_imagesupport_help = {p:local}imagesupport [enable|disable]
	Allow images to be sent in anonymous messages. Enabled by default. Disable with `{p:local}imagesupport disable`
command_botmod_help = {p:local}botmod (user mention)
	Promote users in the server to allow them to shuffle anon-ids without being a mod.
	Demote by adding a minus at the start of the mention.
